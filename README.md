# Dell B1160w drivers for macOS Catalina and higher

Please note that the driver is not created by me and I have only made a few tweaks from the legacy dell drivers to make it work with higher versions of macOS, which did not support the legacy drivers.

This driver is intended to be used for macOS Catalina or higher.

Setup to use the driver:
1. Copy the folders `Dell` and `PPDs` to `/Library/Printers`
2. Open `System Preferences`
3. Goto `Printers & Scanners`
4. Press the `+` icon
5. Select the printer or the printer via its IP address (NOTE: Do not click on add yet)
6. On the `Use` dropdown it should auto select `Dell B1160w Mono Laser Printer`.
7. Click on Add
8. Vola! Your printer has been setup and is ready to print.
